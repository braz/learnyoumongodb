In this exercise, you will USE the database '{bold}mydatabase{/bold}' running on your localhost (127.0.0.1) in port 27017 and you will USE the collection '{bold}zips{/bold}'.

You will load all the records from the 'zips.json' file which is included in the module's data folder or you can download it directly from the MongoDB website (http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json with details at http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set/).

This file contains 29,469 documents with the following format:
{"city": "ACMAR", "loc": [-86.51557, 33.584132], "pop": 6055, "state": "AL", "_id": "35004"}
....
{"city": "THAYNE", "loc": [-111.011354, 42.933026], "pop": 505, "state": "WY", "_id": "83127"}

Stage 1 - Connect to the database, 'mydatabase' and import the file 'zips.json' using the Node MongoDB driver code.

Stage 2 - You will create a compound index on the fields 'pop', state' and 'city'.

Stage 3 - You will query the collection to return the cities with a population over one thousand (1,000) people in the state of California or 'CA', these results should be sorted by population, state and city and the result should be outputted to the console.

Your answer to the exercise will be run against the official solution to ensure
that your query returns the correctly documents.

This exercise assumes a running MongoDB on your local machine. This means
the connection string will again be {yellow}{bold}'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/'{/yellow}{/bold}.

HINTS:

In this exercise, you will need to use the bulk insert method rather than the 'mongoimport' commandline tool (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/) as you will need to programmatically report on the total number of records inserted.

The MongoDB import / export reference can be found at:
{yellow}http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/import-export/{/yellow}
and the insert() method reference can be found at:
{yellow}http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/markdown-docs/insert.html{/yellow}
