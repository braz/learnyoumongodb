Write a program that opens a MongoDB database '{bold}learnmymongodb{/bold}'
and queries the collection '{bold}test{/bold}'.

The collection will contain up to 5 documents with the form:

{blue}{bold}{
	"_id" : ObjectId("XXXX"), 
	"value" : Y
}{/blue}{/bold}

  '{italic}value{/italic}' : '{bold}Y{/bold}'
Where Y is an integer between 50 and 150.

You need to find these documents and print them to the console, ordered by
'{italic}value{/italic}', ascending. You should print them using the following
format assuming '{italic}docs{/italic}' is the variable holding an Array of
documents:

	{blue}{bold}console.dir(docs);{/blue}{/bold}

The full path to the database is the same as previous and assumes a running
MongoDB on your local machine. This means the connection string will again be
{yellow}{bold}'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/learnmymongodb'{/yellow}{/bold}.

As an aside, the ObjectId is automatically generated by MongoDB and used to
uniquely identify a document. It {italic}XXXX{/italic} is a unique 12 byte object consisting of the timestamp when created, a unique machine ID, the process ID of the process which generated the document and the final value is made up of a counter which increments to ensure uniqueness within a second in a single process.

HINTS:

This is similar to the first exercise and you should explore the find and sort
operations as well as toArray to return the documents.

There are a variety of ways to use the sort functionality and a good reference
