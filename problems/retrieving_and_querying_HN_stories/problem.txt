In this exercise, you will USE the database '{bold}mydatabase{/bold}' running on your localhost (127.0.0.1) in port 27017 and you will CREATE the collection '{bold}hackernews{/bold}'.

You will need to install an additional Node module for this exercise, 'request'. This can be installed using the '{yellow}npm install request{yellow}' command at your terminal / command line prompt/

You will use this module to collect and save the front page news from the popular news site, Hacker News. 

You will create special kind of MongoDB index for this data, a text index. In order to create this type of index, you will need to enable text search in MongoDB (see {yellow}http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/enable-text-search/{/yellow} for more details).

The format of the page result you will receive as a JSON object contains the following:
{bold}nextId:{/bold} ID for next page of links
{bold}items:{/bold} array of links, which each link contain the following fields: commentCount, id, points, postedAgo, postedBy, title, url
{bold}cachedOnUTC:{/bold} UTC date and time when request was cached

Stage 1 - Download and install the NodeJS module, 'request'. This can be done using NPM (npm install request) or visit the project webpage for more details (https://github.com/mikeal/request).

Stage 2 - Connect to the Hacker News API and download the current news from its front page using this URL, {yellow}http://api.ihackernews.com/page{/yellow}.

Stage 3 - Connect to the database, 'mydatabase' and import the current front page news of 'hacker news' into a new collection, 'hackernews'.

Stage 4 - Enable the text search capability in MongoBD, this will require you running a command against the {bold}Admin{/bold} database or setting the parameter for your MongoDB when you start it. You must then create a text index on "title" field.

Stage 5 - Use MongoDB's text command to search the collection for the phrase "show hn" and print the results field to the console. You will need to use a different form of query for this with a format of 'db.command({"text": collectionname, "search": searchstring})' as text search (in 2.4) does not support the 'find' method as it is still experimental.

Your answer to the exercise will be run against the official solution to ensure
that your query returns the correctly documents.

This exercise assumes a running MongoDB on your local machine. This means
the connection string will again be {yellow}{bold}'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/'{/yellow}{/bold}.

HINTS

In this exercise, you will need to use install the 'request' module and the specific page you should gather the data from is 'http://api.ihackernews.com/page'.

You MUST also enable {bold}text search{/bold} in your MongoDB as this is not enabled by default (see {yellow}http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/enable-text-search/{/yellow} for more details).
