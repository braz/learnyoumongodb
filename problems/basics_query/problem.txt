In this exercise, you will can use the database '{bold}learnmymongodb{/bold}'
running on your localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 27017 for your solution with the
collection 'userdetails' being where the user information is stored. 

You will need to count the users / documents which contain an age equal to or
greater than a value specific in another document in the same collection. The
value is specified in the field 'seek_this_age_or_older' and there is one (1)
document in the collection 'userdetails' containing the value with the format:

{blue}{bold}
{ "seek_this_age_or_older" : VALUE_TO_USE_FOR_QUERY, "_id" : ObjectId("XXXX") }
{/blue}{/bold}

The other documents take the format in the collection 'userdetails':

{blue}{bold}{ "firstname" : "tony",
	"lastname" : "smith", 
	"age" : "35", 
	"username" : "tsmith", 
	"email" : "tsmith@smith.com", 
	"_id" : ObjectId("XXXX") 
}{/blue}{/bold}

You should count these documents (those containing the field 'age') for
those with an age equal to or greater (older) than the value contained in field
'seek_this_age_or_older' in the same collection. The result you will need to return
to the console is the **count** or number of documents with this age or greater.

Your answer to the exercise will be run against the official solution to ensure
that your query is targeting the correct age range of users.

This exercise assumes a running MongoDB on your local machine. This means
the connection string will again be {yellow}{bold}'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/learnmymongodb'{/yellow}{/bold}.
The collection will be {yellow}{bold}'userdetails'{/yellow}{/bold}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

In this exercise, you will need to use the `collection.find()` with the operator $gte
method but you will need to restrict the find to the range of ages specified. You will
need to find the value (seek_this_age_or_older) in the collection that specifies
the age range to search.
